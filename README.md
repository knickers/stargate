Stargate 3D Model.

This Stargate was designed with exaggerated, extra large symbols so they will be visible when printed small (At least small for FDM printers.)

The inner diameter is 3.0" (76.2mm). Originally designed to fit 3" crafting acrylic discs inside. Filled with 2 part epoxy resin died with silver pigment.
